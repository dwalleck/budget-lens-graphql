- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking**: k6 load testing scenarios for 50-200 concurrent users with <200ms API response times and <100ms GraphQL query performance
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow with automated testing, security scanning, deployment to staging/production environments
- [ ] **Production Infrastructure**: Infrastructure-as-code deployment with monitoring, logging, alerting, and health checks configured

      stages: [
        { duration: '2m', target: 50 },
        { duration: '5m', target: 50 },
        { duration: '2m', target: 100 },
        { duration: '5m', target: 100 },
        { duration: '2m', target: 0 }
      ],
      thresholds: {
        http_req_duration: ['p(95)<200'],
        http_req_failed: ['rate<0.1']
      }
    }
  }
};
```

  name = "budget-lens-prod"
}

resource "aws_rds_instance" "postgresql" {
  engine = "postgres"
  version = "16"
  # High availability, backup configuration
}

  # Application metrics, database metrics, error tracking
}
```

### Test Categories and Coverage

#### Unit Tests (>90% Domain Coverage)
- **Aggregates**: Account, Transaction, Budget, Household behavior validation
- **Value Objects**: Money, DateRange, Category validation and invariants
- **Domain Services**: Budget calculation, categorization logic, debt payoff strategies
- **Event Handling**: Domain event publishing, event sourcing aggregate reconstruction

#### Integration Tests (Repository & Pipeline)

- **Event Store**: Event persistence, aggregate reconstruction, temporal queries
- **MediatR Pipeline**: Command/query handling, validation, error handling
- **GraphQL API**: Schema validation, resolver testing, subscription functionality

#### End-to-End Tests (Critical Flows)

- **Transaction Management**: Import, categorization, splitting, reconciliation
- **Budget Operations**: Creation, allocation, tracking, alerts
- **Reporting**: Dashboard data, export functionality, historical analysis

## Dependencies

**Requires Completion**: All previous tasks (001-009) must be fully implemented and tested

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach
Focus on domain logic validation, business rule enforcement, and edge case handling. Use property-based testing for complex financial calculations and event sourcing scenarios.

### Integration Testing Strategy
Validate complete request/response cycles, database transactions, event publishing, and external service interactions using real components in containerized environments.

### Security Testing Methodology
Implement security testing at multiple layers: static code analysis, dynamic application security testing, dependency scanning, and runtime application self-protection validation.

### Performance Testing Framework
Establish baseline performance metrics, conduct load testing with realistic user scenarios, validate system behavior under stress, and ensure graceful degradation patterns.

This comprehensive testing and deployment task ensures Budget Lens MVP is production-ready with enterprise-grade testing coverage, security validation, performance optimization, and operational reliability.
