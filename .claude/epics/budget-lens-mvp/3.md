# Account Aggregate & Management

## Description

Implement the Account domain aggregate as the foundational entity for financial data management in Budget Lens. This includes support for multiple account types (checking, savings, credit cards, loans, investments) with proper balance tracking, account metadata management, and integration with the event sourcing system.

The Account aggregate will serve as the container for all financial transactions and provide the basis for account-level reporting and analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Account domain aggregate supporting multiple account types with proper business rules
- [ ] Account CRUD operations through GraphQL API with full validation
- [ ] Real-time balance calculation and tracking with event sourcing integration
- [ ] Account metadata management including institution details and account linking
- [ ] Account listing and filtering capabilities with user-based data isolation

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- Create Account aggregate root following DDD patterns with strong invariants
- Implement account type enumeration supporting all major financial account categories
- Use event sourcing for balance calculations and audit trail
- Integrate with user context for multi-tenant data isolation
- Provide GraphQL schema for account management operations

### Key Files to Create/Modify
- `src/BudgetLens.Core/Domain/Accounts/Account.cs` - Account aggregate root
- `src/BudgetLens.Core/Domain/Accounts/AccountType.cs` - Account type enumeration
- `src/BudgetLens.Core/Domain/Accounts/Events/` - Account domain events
- `src/BudgetLens.Application/Accounts/Commands/` - Account CRUD commands
- `src/BudgetLens.Application/Accounts/Queries/` - Account queries and projections
- `src/BudgetLens.Infrastructure/Accounts/` - Account repository and event handlers
- `src/BudgetLens.Api/GraphQL/Accounts/` - Account mutations and queries

### Account Types Support
- **Banking:** Checking, Savings, Money Market
- **Credit:** Credit Cards, Lines of Credit
- **Investment:** Brokerage, Retirement (401k, IRA)
- **Loan:** Mortgage, Auto Loan, Personal Loan
- **Other:** Cash, Cryptocurrency

## Dependencies

### Task Dependencies
- [002] - GraphQL API Foundation (required for GraphQL schema and resolvers)
- [003] - Core Infrastructure & Event Store Setup (required for event persistence and domain infrastructure)

### External Dependencies
- No additional NuGet packages required (uses existing infrastructure)

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** M
**Hours:** 10-14
**Parallel:** true (independent domain aggregate that can be developed alongside other aggregates)

### Breakdown
- Account domain model and business rules: 3 hours
- Account events and event handlers: 2 hours
- Account commands and validation: 3 hours
- Account queries and projections: 2 hours
- GraphQL schema and resolvers: 3 hours
- Testing and validation: 1-3 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] **Code Complete:** Account aggregate implemented with all CRUD operations, balance tracking, and proper business rule enforcement
- [ ] **Tests Pass:** Unit tests for account domain logic, integration tests for account operations, GraphQL resolver tests
- [ ] **Documentation:** Account domain model documented, GraphQL schema updated, account type reference guide created
- [ ] **Code Review:** Domain model design reviewed, event sourcing patterns validated, GraphQL schema approved
- [ ] **Ready to Deploy:** Account management functional with create/read/update/delete operations working through GraphQL API
