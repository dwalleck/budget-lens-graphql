# Database Schema & Event Store Setup

## Description

Implement the complete database infrastructure for Budget Lens using PostgreSQL with Event Sourcing architecture. This includes creating the event store schema, aggregate projections, migration system, and database configuration with proper indexing and performance optimization.

The event store will provide complete audit trails for all financial data while maintaining high performance through optimized projections and caching strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PostgreSQL database schema with event store tables and proper indexing
- [ ] Event store implementation with aggregate persistence and reconstruction
- [ ] Database migration system with version control and rollback capabilities  
- [ ] Projection tables for read model optimization with automatic updates
- [ ] Database connection management with pooling and retry policies

## Dependencies

### Task Dependencies
- [6] - Project Foundation & Architecture Setup (required for infrastructure patterns)

### External Dependencies
- Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** L
**Hours:** 12-16
**Parallel:** true (can work alongside GraphQL setup)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] **Code Complete:** Event store fully implemented with aggregate persistence, projections, and migration system
- [ ] **Database Ready:** PostgreSQL schema created with proper indexes, constraints, and performance optimization
- [ ] **Migration System:** Database migrations working with version control and rollback capability
- [ ] **Performance Validated:** Event store performance meets requirements for financial data volume
- [ ] **Documentation:** Database schema documented, event store patterns explained, migration procedures documented
