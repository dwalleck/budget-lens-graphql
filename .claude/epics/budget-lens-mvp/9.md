# Category System & Management

## Description

Implement a comprehensive hierarchical category system for transaction classification and budget organization. This includes creating category aggregates, supporting custom user categories, implementing category rules and auto-assignment logic, and providing category management through the GraphQL API.

The category system will enable automatic transaction categorization, budget allocation, and financial reporting while supporting both standard categories and user-defined custom categories.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Hierarchical category system with parent-child relationships and unlimited depth
- [ ] Standard category templates (income, expenses, transfers) with customization support
- [ ] Category CRUD operations through GraphQL API with validation
- [ ] Auto-categorization rules based on transaction patterns and merchant matching
- [ ] Category usage analytics and spending pattern analysis

## Dependencies

### Task Dependencies
- [7] - Database Schema & Event Store Setup (required for category persistence)
- [8] - GraphQL API Foundation (required for category API endpoints)

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** M
**Hours:** 12-16
**Parallel:** true (can work alongside account and transaction development)
