# Transaction Aggregate & Management

## Description

Implement the Transaction domain aggregate as the core financial data entity in Budget Lens. This includes comprehensive transaction management with categorization, split transactions, audit trail through event sourcing, and bulk import capabilities for financial data integration.

The Transaction aggregate will provide the foundation for all financial analysis, budgeting, and reporting features while maintaining complete data integrity and auditability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Transaction domain aggregate with support for income, expense, and transfer transaction types
- [ ] Complete transaction CRUD operations with validation and business rule enforcement
- [ ] Transaction categorization system with hierarchical category support
- [ ] Split transaction capabilities for complex financial entries
- [ ] Bulk transaction import with validation and duplicate detection

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- Create Transaction aggregate root with strong domain invariants and validation
- Implement transaction categorization with support for uncategorized transactions
- Use event sourcing for complete transaction audit trail and temporal queries
- Support split transactions as first-class domain concept
- Integrate with Account aggregate for balance updates and consistency
- Provide bulk import capabilities for CSV/OFX file processing

### Key Files to Create/Modify
- `src/BudgetLens.Core/Domain/Transactions/Transaction.cs` - Transaction aggregate root
- `src/BudgetLens.Core/Domain/Transactions/TransactionType.cs` - Transaction type enumeration
- `src/BudgetLens.Core/Domain/Transactions/Category.cs` - Transaction category entity
- `src/BudgetLens.Core/Domain/Transactions/Events/` - Transaction domain events
- `src/BudgetLens.Application/Transactions/Commands/` - Transaction CRUD and bulk import commands
- `src/BudgetLens.Application/Transactions/Queries/` - Transaction queries with filtering and pagination
- `src/BudgetLens.Infrastructure/Transactions/` - Transaction repository and event handlers
- `src/BudgetLens.Api/GraphQL/Transactions/` - Transaction mutations and queries

### Transaction Features
- **Core Properties:** Amount, date, description, reference number, account linkage
- **Categorization:** Hierarchical categories with auto-suggestion capability
- **Split Transactions:** Multiple category allocations within single transaction
- **Transaction Types:** Income, Expense, Transfer (between accounts)
- **Bulk Operations:** Import from CSV/OFX, bulk categorization, batch updates
- **Audit Trail:** Complete change history through event sourcing

## Dependencies

### Task Dependencies
- [002] - GraphQL API Foundation (required for GraphQL schema and resolvers)
- [003] - Core Infrastructure & Event Store Setup (required for event persistence)
- [005] - Account Aggregate & Management (required for account linking and balance updates)

### External Dependencies
- CsvHelper (for CSV import functionality)
- Potential OFX parsing library for bank data import

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** L
**Hours:** 16-20
**Parallel:** false (depends on Account aggregate completion)

### Breakdown
- Transaction domain model and business rules: 4 hours
- Transaction events and category system: 3 hours
- Transaction commands with validation: 4 hours
- Transaction queries with filtering: 3 hours
- Split transaction logic: 2 hours
- Bulk import functionality: 3 hours
- GraphQL schema and resolvers: 2 hours
- Testing and validation: 3-5 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] **Code Complete:** Transaction aggregate implemented with all CRUD operations, categorization, split transactions, and bulk import capabilities
- [ ] **Tests Pass:** Unit tests for transaction domain logic, integration tests with account updates, bulk import validation tests
- [ ] **Documentation:** Transaction domain model documented, categorization system guide, bulk import format specifications
- [ ] **Code Review:** Domain model design reviewed, event sourcing integration validated, performance considerations addressed
- [ ] **Ready to Deploy:** Transaction management fully functional with create/read/update/delete operations, categorization, and bulk import working through GraphQL API
