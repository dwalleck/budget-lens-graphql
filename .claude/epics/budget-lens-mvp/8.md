# GraphQL API Foundation

## Description

Establish the complete GraphQL API foundation using HotChocolate 15.x framework with proper schema design, middleware configuration, and integration with the hexagonal architecture. This includes setting up GraphQL endpoints, subscription support, error handling, and performance optimization.

The GraphQL API will serve as the primary interface for all client applications, providing type-safe queries, mutations, and real-time subscriptions for financial data.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] HotChocolate GraphQL server configured with schema-first approach
- [ ] GraphQL middleware pipeline with authentication, validation, and error handling
- [ ] Subscription support for real-time updates and notifications
- [ ] GraphQL schema introspection and documentation generation
- [ ] Performance optimization with DataLoader and query complexity analysis

## Dependencies

### Task Dependencies
- [6] - Project Foundation & Architecture Setup (required for application infrastructure)

### External Dependencies
- HotChocolate.AspNetCore 15.x
- HotChocolate.Data (for filtering and pagination)
- HotChocolate.Subscriptions.InMemory

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** M
**Hours:** 10-14
**Parallel:** true (can work alongside database setup)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] **Code Complete:** GraphQL server fully configured with schema, middleware, and subscription support
- [ ] **Schema Functional:** GraphQL introspection working, queries and mutations properly resolved
- [ ] **Real-time Ready:** Subscription infrastructure functional for live updates
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Proper error responses and logging throughout GraphQL pipeline
- [ ] **Documentation:** GraphQL schema documented, API usage examples provided, middleware configuration explained
