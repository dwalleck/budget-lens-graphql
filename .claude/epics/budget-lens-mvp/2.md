# Authentication & User Management System

## Description

Implement a comprehensive authentication and user management system for Budget Lens using JWT tokens and .NET Identity. This includes secure user registration, login, password management, and profile management capabilities integrated with the GraphQL API.

The system will provide the foundation for user-based data isolation and household management features, supporting both individual users and future multi-user household scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] JWT-based authentication system with secure token generation and validation
- [ ] User registration with email verification and password strength requirements
- [ ] Secure login/logout with proper session management and token refresh
- [ ] User profile management including password changes and account settings
- [ ] GraphQL mutations and queries for all authentication operations

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach
- Use ASP.NET Core Identity for user management with custom User entity
- Implement JWT authentication with HotChocolate GraphQL integration
- Create authentication middleware for GraphQL context
- Add password hashing with proper salt and security standards
- Implement email verification workflow (stub for MVP)

### Key Files to Create/Modify
- `src/BudgetLens.Core/Domain/Users/User.cs` - User aggregate root
- `src/BudgetLens.Core/Domain/Users/Events/` - User domain events
- `src/BudgetLens.Application/Users/Commands/` - Registration, login commands
- `src/BudgetLens.Application/Users/Queries/` - User profile queries
- `src/BudgetLens.Infrastructure/Identity/` - Identity configuration and services
- `src/BudgetLens.Api/GraphQL/Users/` - User mutations and queries
- `src/BudgetLens.Api/Authentication/` - JWT middleware and configuration

### Authentication Flow
1. User registration creates User aggregate and generates verification token
2. Login validates credentials and returns JWT access/refresh tokens
3. GraphQL requests include JWT token in Authorization header
4. Authentication middleware validates token and populates GraphQL context
5. User context available for authorization in resolvers

## Dependencies

### Task Dependencies
- [003] - Core Infrastructure & Event Store Setup (required for user event persistence)

### External Dependencies
- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
- System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt
- HotChocolate.AspNetCore.Authorization

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** L
**Hours:** 16-20
**Parallel:** true (can be developed alongside other domain aggregates)

### Breakdown
- User domain model and events: 3 hours
- Identity infrastructure setup: 4 hours
- JWT authentication middleware: 3 hours
- GraphQL authentication integration: 4 hours
- User management commands/queries: 4 hours
- Testing and validation: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] **Code Complete:** All authentication components implemented with proper error handling and security measures
- [ ] **Tests Pass:** Unit tests for user commands/queries, integration tests for authentication flow, security validation tests
- [ ] **Documentation:** Authentication setup guide, GraphQL schema documentation, security considerations documented
- [ ] **Code Review:** Security review completed, authentication patterns approved, JWT implementation validated
- [ ] **Ready to Deploy:** Authentication system functional with user registration/login working end-to-end
