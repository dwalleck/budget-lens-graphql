# Traditional Budget Implementation

## Description

Implement the traditional budgeting system as the primary budgeting strategy for Budget Lens MVP. This includes budget creation, category allocation, spending tracking, budget period management, and budget performance analytics with overspending alerts and recommendations.

The traditional budget provides users with a familiar zero-based budgeting approach where income is allocated across expense categories with real-time tracking and variance analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Budget aggregate with period-based budget management (monthly, quarterly, annual)
- [ ] Category allocation system with spending limits and tracking
- [ ] Real-time budget vs actual spending analysis with variance reporting
- [ ] Budget rollover and carryover logic for unused allocations
- [ ] Budget alerts and notifications for overspending and approaching limits

## Dependencies

### Task Dependencies
- [3] - Account Aggregate & Management (required for account linking and balance integration)
- [4] - Transaction Aggregate & Management (required for spending tracking)
- [9] - Category System & Management (required for budget category allocations)

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** L
**Hours:** 16-20
**Parallel:** false (depends on accounts, transactions, and categories)
