2. Delayed DevOps and Deployment Strategy: The timeline defers "Production deployment pipeline" and
      "Monitoring and logging setup" to the last two weeks (13-14). This is a major risk. A continuous
      integration and deployment (CI/CD) strategy should be established in the first two weeks to
      automate testing and deployments, reducing risk and improving velocity.

   3. Ambiguous Testing Strategy: The plan mentions setting up test frameworks and writing tests at the
      end. A more robust plan would define the testing strategy upfront. For this architecture, it would
       be beneficial to specify the approach for different types of tests (e.g., unit tests for domain
      logic, integration tests for CQRS handlers, and end-to-end tests for GraphQL endpoints).

   4. Aggressive Timeline: The 14-week timeline is ambitious for building a new application with this
      level of architectural sophistication, even with a reduced feature set. The risk of "Complex
      architecture slows initial development" is noted, but the timeline leaves little room for
      unforeseen challenges.

  Conclusion:

  The mvp-development-plan.md is a high-quality document that provides sufficient detail to begin
  backend development. The architectural and data modeling decisions are sound and forward-looking.

  However, it is not a complete MVP development plan on its own. The lack of a corresponding frontend
  strategy and the delayed consideration of DevOps represent significant risks to the project's success
   and timeline.

  Recommendation: I would recommend approving the backend portion of this plan but making the immediate
   creation of a detailed frontend development plan and an iterative DevOps strategy a prerequisite
  before kicking off the project.
